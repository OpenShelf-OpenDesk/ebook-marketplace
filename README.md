A NFT marketplace for e-Book. Here, Authors can self publish books. Readers can buy or sell books while compensating the author on every exchange transaction.

## **Our Vision**

We firmly believe that Internet has not just made information sharing smooth and easy but also have promoted people to self-learn from online resources. Among these resources, Wikipedia is a wellspring of information and YouTube being a quick-learn companion. But books not just provide information or short-time learnings but alleviate gaining expertise and thus are more impactful overall.

## **Our Mission**

To further promote self-learning, by making quality books accessible and cheap for all. Smart phones are integral part of present human life and thus we want to leverage it for reading eBooks and saving trees by reducing paper books.

## **What we provide as of now?**

Authors can self publish books, even anonymously, having all freedom and no censorship over the content. Publisher can easily control market supply, update book price, add sequels or new editions, and can withdraw revenue or split it amongst the contributors. Also, they receive specified royalty as compensation for every exchange transaction. Books can also be distributed for free, either to publicize or as a donation.

Readers can buy directly from Authors. As the books can be self-published, authors can earn better even by selling books at cheaper prices. Readers can sell books which are less likely to be read again in future, and regaining most of the book cost. Readers get an inbuilt native ebook reader and does not require to use any other dedicated software.

If readers want to save books for future reads, they can still generate revenue in realtime by putting books on rent. This allows other readers to read books at relatively lower prices without purchasing.
